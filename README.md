CrisisLex
=========

CrisisLex (http://CrisisLex.org/) is a repository of crisis-related social media data and tools. Currently it includes collections of crisis tweets and a lexicon of crisis terms. It also includes tools to help you create these collections and lexicons.

This repository contains the following sub-directories (Work-in-Progress):

data/
-----

The directory `data/` contains tweets and keywords used or produced during the construction of the lexicon or other analyses.

src-collect/
------------

The directory `src-collect/` contains scripts that can be used to collect tweets using this lexicon.

src-create/
------------

The directory `src-create/` contains the scripts that can be used to create a new lexicon based on labeled tweets.
